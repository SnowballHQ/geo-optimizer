# Puppeteer Deployment Guide for Render

## Issue
The error you're seeing is because Puppeteer can't find Chrome in the Render deployment environment. This is a common issue when deploying Puppeteer-based applications.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Use the Updated render.yaml (Recommended)

The `render.yaml` file has been updated to:
1. Install Chrome during the build process
2. Set the `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable
3. Configure Puppeteer to use the installed Chrome

### Solution 2: Manual Deployment Steps

If you're not using the render.yaml file, follow these steps:

#### 1. Update Environment Variables
In your Render backend service, add this environment variable:
```
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable
```

#### 2. Update Build Command
Set your build command to:
```bash
# Install Chrome dependencies
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
  ca-certificates \
  fonts-liberation \
  libappindicator3-1 \
  libasound2 \
  libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
  libdrm2 \
  libgtk-3-0 \
  libnspr4 \
  libnss3 \
  libxcomposite1 \
  libxdamage1 \
  libxrandr2 \
  xdg-utils \
  libxss1 \
  libxtst6 \
  libx11-xcb1 \
  libxcb-dri3-0 \
  libdrm2 \
  libgbm1 \
  libasound2 \
  libatspi2.0-0 \
  libxshmfence1 \
  wget \
  gnupg

# Install Chrome
wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
apt-get update && apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable

# Install Node.js dependencies
cd backend && npm install
```

#### 3. Update Start Command
Set your start command to:
```bash
cd backend && npm start
```

### Solution 3: Fallback Mechanism (Already Implemented)

The code has been updated to include a fallback mechanism:
- If Puppeteer fails, it automatically falls back to using axios + cheerio
- This ensures the application continues to work even if Chrome installation fails
- The fallback provides basic SEO data extraction without advanced features

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Updated WebsiteScraper.js
- Added `executablePath` configuration for Puppeteer
- Added extensive Chrome launch arguments for serverless environments
- Implemented fallback to axios scraping when Puppeteer fails

### 2. Added Environment Variable Support
- `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` tells Puppeteer where to find Chrome
- Falls back to system Chrome if not specified

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Puppeteer fails
- Automatic fallback to simpler scraping method
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Deploy with Updated Configuration
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Puppeteer deployment for Render"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check Logs
In Render dashboard, check the build logs for:
- Chrome installation success
- Puppeteer initialization
- Any fallback to axios scraping

### 3. Test the API
```bash
curl https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/v1/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Chrome Installation Fails
1. Check build logs for permission errors
2. Verify the build command is correct
3. Try using the fallback mechanism (already implemented)

### If Puppeteer Still Fails
1. The fallback mechanism will automatically use axios
2. Check logs for "Puppeteer failed, falling back to axios" message
3. Basic SEO data will still be extracted

### Performance Considerations
- Puppeteer provides more detailed analysis
- Axios fallback provides basic SEO data
- Both methods will work for category extraction

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Different Service
Consider using services that support Puppeteer out of the box:
- Railway
- Heroku (with buildpacks)
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### Option 2: Use External Scraping Service
- ScrapingBee
- ScraperAPI
- Bright Data

### Option 3: Simplify Requirements
- Remove Puppeteer dependency
- Use only axios + cheerio for basic scraping
- Focus on essential SEO data extraction

## Current Status

✅ **Fallback mechanism implemented** - App will work even if Puppeteer fails
✅ **Chrome installation script added** - Should work on Render
✅ **Environment variables configured** - Proper Chrome path setup
✅ **Error handling improved** - Graceful degradation

The application should now work reliably on Render with or without Puppeteer!
