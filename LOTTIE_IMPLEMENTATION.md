## 🎨 Animation Guidelines

### What to Look For:
- ✅ **Modern & Minimal:** Clean lines, professional
- ✅ **Brand Colors:** Purple (#6658f4), white, grays
- ✅ **Smooth:** 60fps, fluid motion
- ✅ **Small File Size:** Under 100KB per file
- ✅ **Appropriate Duration:** 1-5 seconds max

### What to Avoid:
- ❌ Cartoonish or childish styles
- ❌ Bright, clashing colors
- ❌ Overly complex animations (laggy)
- ❌ Large file sizes (>200KB)
- ❌ Long durations (>5 seconds)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Test Before Downloading All**
Download 1-2 animations first to see if the style matches your brand

### 2. **Use Consistent Styles**
Try to pick animations from the same creator/pack for consistency

### 3. **dotLottie Format**
If a file is too large, use dotLottie format (smaller size, same quality)

### 4. **Fallback is Built-in**
If an animation fails to load, the original icon will show automatically

### 5. **Mobile-Friendly**
Floating animations in hero section hide on mobile (responsive design)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Animation Not Showing?

1. **Check file path:**
   - Make sure file is in correct folder
   - Verify filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Example: `/animations/ui/loading.json` not `/Animations/UI/Loading.json`

2. **Check file format:**
   - Must be `.json` or `.lottie` format
   - Open file in text editor - should be valid JSON

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for errors in Console tab
   - Network tab shows if file loaded

4. **Verify JSON structure:**
   - Open animation file
   - Should start with `{` and contain Lottie data

### Animation Too Big or Laggy?

1. **Use dotLottie format** (smaller)
2. **Simplify animation** on LottieFiles editor
3. **Reduce duration** or complexity
4. **Compress JSON** online
